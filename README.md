# understrap-child
Basic Child Theme for UnderStrap Theme Framework: https://github.com/understrap/understrap

## How it works
Understrap Child Theme shares with the parent theme all PHP files and adds its own functions.php on top of the UnderStrap parent theme's functions.php.

**IT DOES NOT LOAD THE PARENT THEMES CSS FILE(S)!** Instead it uses the UnderStrap Parent Theme as a dependency via npm and compiles its own CSS file from it.

Understrap Child Theme uses the Enqueue method to load and sort the CSS file the right way instead of the old @import method.

## Installation
1. Install the parent theme UnderStrap first: `https://github.com/understrap/understrap`
   - IMPORTANT: If you download UnderStrap from GitHub make sure you rename the "understrap-master.zip" file to "understrap.zip" or you might have problems using this child theme!
1. Upload the understrap-child folder to your wp-content/themes directory
1. Go into your WP admin backend
1. Go to "Appearance -> Themes"
1. Activate the UnderStrap Child theme

## Editing
Add your own CSS styles to `/sass/theme/_child_theme.scss`
or import you own files into `/sass/theme/understrap-child.scss`

To overwrite Bootstrap's or UnderStrap's base variables just add your own value to:
`/sass/theme/_child_theme_variables.scss`

For example, the "$brand-primary" variable is used by both Bootstrap and UnderStrap.

Add your own color like: `$brand-primary: #ff6600;` in `/sass/theme/_child_theme_variables.scss` to overwrite it. This change will automatically apply to all elements that use the $brand-primary variable.

It will be outputted into:
`/css/understrap-child.min.css` and `/css/understrap-child.css`

So you have one clean CSS file at the end and just one request.

## Developing With NPM, Gulp, SASS and Browser Sync

### Installing Dependencies
- Make sure you have installed Node.js, Gulp, and Browser-Sync [1] on your computer globally
- Open your terminal and browse to the location of your UnderStrap copy
- Run: `$ npm install` then: `$ gulp copy-assets`

### Running
To work and compile your Sass files on the fly start:

- `$ gulp watch`

Or, to run with Browser-Sync:

- First change the browser-sync options to reflect your environment in the file `/gulpconfig.json` in the beginning of the file:
```javascript
  "browserSyncOptions" : {
    "proxy": "localhost/wordpress/",
    "notify": false
  }
};
```
- then run: `$ gulp watch-bs`

### Pushing Updates / Releases

1. Make And Commit Your Theme Updates
Edit your theme, make whatever changes, modifications, additions you need.

Commit your changes to your local git repo and push those changes to Github.

2. Update The Version Number in Style.css
In your style.css file, increment your version number, as in this example:

Theme Name: Example  
Theme URI: http://example.com/  
Github Theme URI: https://github.com/username/repo-name
Description: My Example Theme
Author: person
Version: v1.1.0
Commit the change locally and push the change to Github. (And yes, this could have simply been done as part of step #1.

3. Create a new tag and push the tag
Create a tag in git that matches the version number in step #2 and push that tag up to Github:

$ git tag v1.1.0
$ git push origin v1.1.0
